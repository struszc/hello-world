# hello-world
GitHub guide says to make this 

Chris here, attempting to learn git and github as well as some Ruby. I am going to document my journey on a seperate repo. I am wearing a github t-shirt. It says "I Code" with an octocat. Ironic, as I don't code... yet but the sister unit sent it and it is made with the softest fabric ever.
